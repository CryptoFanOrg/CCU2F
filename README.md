# u2f-jc-applet
This U2F JavaCard Applet is based on the [Ledger U2F Applet](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-u2f-javacard). I import this applet to Eclipse with installed JCOP Tools and modified the AID of this applet to the standardized AID for FIDO NFC token (	0xA0000006472F0001). I also provide some example data (Attestation Certificate and Key) to bring this applet to run.
